The game engine needs to be able to:

  Display the game script (story):
    - Text-wrapped to n chars (suggest 70)
    - Optional special effects, like "typing"

  Capture user input:
    - Sanitize (lower) and optionally remove articles ("the", "a", etc)
    - Split into a list 
    - Validate commands and objects (is "objects" correct here? I'm talking about the object of the command, e.g., print(object))
    - Build and run commands
    - Handle exceptions -> Help

  Update player status:
    - Manage inventory transfers
    - Update player location
    - Optionally manage "health"
    - Optionally save player status to a file

  Manage game flow:
    - Branch based on player decisions
    - Help

Datasets:
  - Scripts (including branching commands)
  - Places
  - Things
  - Player
  - Commands
